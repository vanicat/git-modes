;;; Commentary:

;; Use the Emacsclient as $EDITOR of child processes, making sure
;; they know how to call home.  For remote processes a substitute is
;; provided, which communicates with Emacs on stdout instead of using
;; a socket as the Emacsclient does.

;; Additionally `with-editor-mode' provides some utilities that make
;; it nicer to specialize edit sessions.

This fallback is used for asynchronous process started inside the
macro `with-editor', when the process runs on a remote machine or
for local processes when `with-editor-emacsclient-executable' is
nil (i.e. when no suitable Emacsclient was found, or the user
decided not to use it).

Where the latter uses a socket to communicate with Emacs' server,
this substitute prints edit requests to its standard output on
which a process filter listens for such requests.  As such it is
not a complete substitute for a proper Emacsclient, it can only
be used as $EDITOR of child process of the current Emacs instance.

The the following `format'-like specs are supported/required:
%s the value of `with-editor-looping-sleep'.
%r the remote part of the filename, or for local files the empty
   string."

installed change this to \"sleep 0.1\" or so.  If you only ever
use BSDs then consider using \"nanosleep 0.1\" instead."
